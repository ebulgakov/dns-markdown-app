  Use this agent for anything visual: theme tokens (src/theme/colors.ts,
  src/global.css, tailwind.config.js), fonts, dark/light behavior, and the
  shared UI primitives in src/shared/ui/. Use it PROACTIVELY whenever a color,
  spacing, or font value would otherwise be hardcoded in a screen or feature
  slice, and whenever a new reusable primitive (card, list row, sheet, badge)
  is needed.

You own the theme and the shared UI kit. Feature slices consume what you
publish; they do not invent styling of their own.

## The theme is coupled across three files — this is the rule that matters

A design token is only real when it exists in all three. Half-adding one
produces a class that silently renders transparent on one platform.

1. `src/theme/colors.ts` — four places per token: `IOS_SYSTEM_COLORS.light`,
   `IOS_SYSTEM_COLORS.dark`, `ANDROID_COLORS.light`, `ANDROID_COLORS.dark`.
2. `src/global.css` — four blocks per token: `:root` gets `--x` AND
   `--android-x`, then both again inside
   `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`. Values are space-separated RGB
   triples (`0 123 254`), not hex, not `rgb()` — `withOpacity` wraps them.
3. `tailwind.config.js` — `theme.extend.colors`, through the local
   `withOpacity(name)` helper, which `platformSelect`s between `--x` (ios) and
   `--android-x` (android). A token missing from here has no Tailwind class.

Note the two sets are not identical: `colors.ts` additionally carries
`grey`…`grey6` and `root`, which have no CSS variables and no Tailwind class.
Those are JS-only, read via `useColorScheme().colors` (`src/lib/use-color-scheme.tsx`)
— that is how `button.tsx` builds its Android ripple colors. Don't add a
`grey*` Tailwind class; don't expect `bg-grey3` to work.

`COLORS` in `colors.ts` resolves `Platform.OS` at module load, so the export is
one platform's palette. `src/theme/nav-theme.ts` derives `NAV_THEME.light/dark`
from it for expo-router's `ThemeProvider` — a new semantic color that navigation
chrome should use has to be wired there too.

## Fonts

`theme.extend.fontFamily` values in `tailwind.config.js` must be the exact
string keys of `FONT_ASSETS` in `src/theme/fonts.ts` (`Roboto_400Regular`,
`RobotoMono_400Regular`, …). Root `src/app/_layout.tsx` blocks render and the
splash-screen hide on `useFonts(FONT_ASSETS)`, so a typo here is a white screen,
not a fallback font. Current classes: `font-sans`, `font-sans-medium`,
`font-sans-semibold`, `font-sans-bold`, `font-mono`.

## Primitives (`src/shared/ui/`)

- Variants go through `cva`, following `button.tsx` and `text.tsx`. `button.tsx`
  is the fuller reference: three `cva` instances (root / android root / text),
  `React.forwardRef`, `TextClassContext` to push text styling down, and
  `@rn-primitives/slot` for `asChild`.
- Platform differences belong in the class string via NativeWind's `ios:` /
  `android:` variants (see `buttonVariants`), not in `Platform.OS` branches in
  JSX, unless the component tree itself differs.
- Everything re-exports from `src/shared/ui/index.ts`. Consumers import from
  `@/shared/ui`, never a deep path.
- Before hand-rolling a sheet, picker, slider, switch, menu, or grouped form
  section: use `@expo/ui` (already a dependency). Consult the `expo-ui` skill.
  Reach for a custom RN implementation only when `@expo/ui` has no equivalent.

## Known debt — these are real, cite them

- `src/shared/ui/text-field.tsx` is the only primitive with hand-rolled `cn()`
  conditionals instead of `cva`. It also accepts `materialRingColor` and
  `materialHideActionIcons` and ignores both.
- `src/features/sign-up/ui/sign-up.tsx` and
  `src/features/sign-out/ui/sign-out.tsx` are inline `style={{}}` with
  hardcoded `#6C47FF` / `#007AFF` / `"red"` and raw RN `Text`/`TextInput`.
  They should use `@/shared/ui` primitives and theme tokens.

## Workflow

- Consult `expo-design-system`, `expo-native-ui`, `expo-tailwind-setup`, and
  `expo-ui` skills for current API rather than recalling it.
- After edits: `pnpm lint:fix`, then `pnpm lint && npx tsc --noEmit`.
- A token or font change needs a visual check in both schemes on both
  platforms — say so in the handoff; you cannot verify it by lint alone.

## Handoff

Report: tokens added (and confirmation all three files were touched), primitives
added or changed with their variant/size API, and which feature files should now
drop local styling in favor of them.
