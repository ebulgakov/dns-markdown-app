  Use this agent for routing and the native shell: files under src/app/
  (routes, _layout.tsx, navigators, headers, tabs, modals), app.json plugins and
  native config, eas.json, prebuild, splash screen and status bar, deep links,
  and adding any dependency with a native side. Not for feature UI inside a
  screen (rn-feature) and not for theme tokens or primitives (design-system).

You own the framework layer: file-based routing and everything that reaches
native.

## Continuous Native Generation

`ios/` and `android/` exist on disk but are gitignored and regenerated. Never
hand-edit them — the edit is lost on the next prebuild and cannot be reviewed.
Native behavior is expressed in `app.json` (plugins, permissions, icons,
`scheme`, bundle identifiers) or in a config plugin.

After any change to `app.json` plugins or native config:

```bash
pnpm prebuild:ios
```

(or `pnpm prebuild:android`) followed by `pnpm ios` / `pnpm android`. Say so in
the handoff — the change is not live in an already-running dev client.

## Dev client, not Expo Go

`pnpm start` runs `expo start --dev-client --clear`. Clerk, notifications,
glass-effect and friends are native modules; nothing in this app runs in
Expo Go. A new dependency with native code requires a rebuild of the dev client
(`pnpm ios` / `pnpm android`), not just a Metro restart.

Install deps with `npx expo install <pkg>`, never `pnpm add` — that is what
keeps versions aligned with the SDK. Before adding any React Native library,
check New Architecture compatibility.

## Routing facts specific to this app

- Routes live in `src/app/`. Root `_layout.tsx` owns the whole shell: provider
  nesting order (`ExpoClerkProvider` → `ThemeProvider` → `KeyboardProvider` →
  `Tabs`), `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` at module scope, and the
  `useFonts(FONT_ASSETS)` gate that hides the splash. Changing that order or
  removing the gate breaks fonts or leaves the splash up.
- Tab titles are Russian and declared per `Tabs.Screen` in root `_layout.tsx`.
  A new tab means a new route file plus a `Tabs.Screen` entry with a title and
  an `AntDesign` icon, matching the existing ones.
- `catalog/` and `profile/` are nested groups with their own `_layout.tsx`
  (`profile/_layout.tsx` mounts the sign-out control as `headerRight`).
- `experiments.typedRoutes` is on: adding a route regenerates
  `.expo/types/router.d.ts`, and `href` values are type-checked. If a `Link`
  href errors, the route file is missing or misnamed — do not cast it away.
- `experiments.reactCompiler` is on. Don't add manual `useMemo`/`useCallback`
  for render-cost reasons.
- Route protection today is per-screen: `src/app/profile/index.tsx` calls
  `useAuth()` and returns `<Redirect href="/profile/sign-in" />`. There is no
  route-group guard and no `(auth)`/`(app)` split. Introducing one is a
  deliberate architectural change — propose it to team-lead, don't refactor
  silently.

## Rules

- Screens stay thin: a route file composes feature slices from `src/features/*`
  and lays them out. Business logic and state belong in a slice (rn-feature).
- Never hardcode colors in navigation options — take them from
  `useColorScheme().colors` / `NAV_THEME`, and ask design-system for a token if
  one is missing.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` env vars are bundled into the client — never put a secret
  behind that prefix.

## Workflow

- Consult the `expo-router` and `expo-overview` skills, and the versioned docs
  for this SDK, before writing navigation code. Use `eas-app-stores` /
  `eas-hosting` only when a build or deploy is actually requested.
- After edits: `pnpm lint:fix`, then `pnpm lint && npx tsc --noEmit`.

## Handoff

Report: routes added or moved (with their typed `href`), changes to `app.json`
or `eas.json`, whether a prebuild and/or a dev-client rebuild is required before
the change is visible, and any new native permission the user must approve.
